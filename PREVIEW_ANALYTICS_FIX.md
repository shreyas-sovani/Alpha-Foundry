# Preview Analytics Bug Fix - October 23, 2025

## TL;DR
Fixed 3 critical bugs causing absurd percentage values (1.5 billion%, -100%, etc.) in preview endpoint analytics. Root cause: **comparing incompatible prices across different swap directions**.

---

## üêõ Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. **spread_percent: 1,503,619,817% (1.5 BILLION PERCENT!)**

**Symptom**: 
```json
"spread_percent": 1503619817.12,
"alert": "üéØ ARB OPPORTUNITY: PoolA‚ÜíPoolB +1503619817.12%"
```

**Root Cause**:
The code was comparing prices from two pools without checking if they're comparable:
- **Pool A (USDC/WETH)**: `price = 3880` (WETH‚ÜíUSDC swap, price = USDC_out / WETH_in)
- **Pool B (USDT/WETH)**: `price = 0.000257` (USDT‚ÜíWETH swap, price = WETH_out / USDT_in)

These are **inverted price ratios**! Comparing them directly:
```python
spread = ((3880 - 0.000257) / 0.000257) * 100 = 1,503,619,817%
```

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Check if prices are in same direction (magnitude)
price_ratio = max(price_a, price_b) / min(price_a, price_b)

if price_ratio < 100:  # Prices are comparable (within 100x)
    spread_percent = ((price_a - price_b) / price_b) * 100.0
    
    # Sanity check: reject spreads >50%
    if abs(spread_percent) > 50:
        spread_reason = "spread too large (>50%), likely bad data"
else:
    spread_reason = f"prices incomparable (ratio {price_ratio:.1f}x)"
```

---

### 2. **price_trend: -100.00%**

**Symptom**:
```json
"price_trend": "üìâ -100.00%"
```

**Root Cause**:
The trend calculation compared the FIRST row (newest) with the LAST row (oldest) without checking if they're from the **same pool**:
- First row: Pool B (USDT‚ÜíWETH): `price = 0.000257`
- Last row: Pool A (WETH‚ÜíUSDC): `price = 3880`

Formula:
```python
trend = ((0.000257 - 3880) / 3880) * 100 = -99.993% ‚Üí rounds to -100%
```

**Fix Applied**:
```python
first_pool = enriched_rows[0].get("pool_id")
last_pool = enriched_rows[-1].get("pool_id")

# CRITICAL: Only compare prices from the SAME POOL
if first_price and last_price and first_pool == last_pool:
    trend_pct = ((first_price - last_price) / last_price) * 100.0
    
    # Sanity check: reject trends >200%
    if abs(trend_pct) > 1.0 and abs(trend_pct) < 200:
        price_trend = f"{'üìà' if trend_pct > 0 else 'üìâ'} {trend_pct:+.2f}%"
```

---

### 3. **delta_vs_ma: -100, 400, etc.**

**Symptom**:
```json
"delta_vs_ma": -100,
"mev_warning": "‚ö†Ô∏è  Price 100.0% from MA"
```

**Root Cause**:
My initial fix had **backwards logic**:
```python
# WRONG: Checks abs difference, not percentage
if ma5 > 0 and abs(ma5 - normalized_price) / ma5 < 100:
    delta_vs_ma = ((normalized_price - ma5) / ma5) * 100.0
```

This allowed extreme values to pass through because:
- `abs(3880 - 0.000257) / 0.000257 = 15,031,198` which is NOT `< 100`
- But when check failed, it set `delta_vs_ma = None`
- Yet `-100` still appeared... 

**Actual Issue**: The check should be AFTER calculating the delta, not before!

**Fix Applied**:
```python
if ma5 > 0:
    # Calculate delta FIRST
    delta_vs_ma = ((normalized_price - ma5) / ma5) * 100.0
    
    # THEN validate the result
    if abs(delta_vs_ma) < 1000:  # Reject >1000% swings
        enriched["delta_vs_ma"] = round(delta_vs_ma, 2)
        
        if abs(delta_vs_ma) > 10.0:
            enriched["mev_warning"] = f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Price {abs(delta_vs_ma):.1f}% from MA"
    else:
        enriched["delta_vs_ma"] = None
```

### 4. **delta_vs_prev_row: 1,497,856,880%**

**Symptom**:
```json
"delta_vs_prev_row": 1498563988.081
```

**Root Cause**:
The code compared sequential rows in the array without checking:
1. If they're from the **same pool**
2. If they're **temporally close** (within reasonable time window)

Since rows are sorted DESC (newest first), it was comparing swaps that could be hours apart or from different pools!

**Fix Applied**:
```python
for i in range(len(enriched_rows) - 1):
    current_row = enriched_rows[i]
    prev_row = enriched_rows[i + 1]
    
    # Only compare prices from the SAME pool
    if current_row.get("pool_id") != prev_row.get("pool_id"):
        current_row["delta_vs_prev_row"] = None
        continue
    
    # Sanity checks: valid prices and reasonable time proximity
    time_diff_seconds = abs(current_ts - prev_ts)
    
    if (current_price and prev_price and prev_price > 0 and 
        time_diff_seconds < 3600):  # Only within 1 hour
        delta_pct = ((current_price - prev_price) / prev_price) * 100.0
        
        # Reject absurd swings (>500%)
        if abs(delta_pct) < 500:
            current_row["delta_vs_prev_row"] = round(delta_pct, 3)
```

## üìä Why This Happened

### The normalized_price Problem

The `normalized_price` field is calculated as:
```python
normalized_price = amount_out / amount_in
```

This means the **direction matters**:
- **WETH ‚Üí USDC**: `3880 USDC / 1 WETH = 3880` (price of 1 WETH in USDC)
- **USDT ‚Üí WETH**: `0.064 WETH / 248 USDT = 0.000258` (price of 1 USDT in WETH)

These represent:
- First: "How much USDC per WETH?"
- Second: "How much WETH per USDT?"

**You cannot compare these directly!** It's like comparing "miles per gallon" with "gallons per mile".

### Proper Comparison Requires Standardization

To properly compare prices across pools, you need to:
1. Detect token pairs and swap direction
2. Standardize all prices to a common base (e.g., always "USDC per WETH")
3. Handle inverse prices: `if (price < 0.1) { price = 1/price }`

This is beyond the scope of the MVP fix, so I added **sanity checks** to reject incomparable values instead.

## üéØ Expected Results After Deployment

### Before (Bad Data)
```json
{
  "spread_percent": 1503619817.12,
  "price_trend": "üìâ -100.00%",
  "preview_rows": [
    {
      "delta_vs_ma": -100,
      "delta_vs_prev_row": 1498563988.081
    }
  ]
}
```

### After (Clean Data)
```json
{
  "spread_percent": null,
  "spread_reason": "prices incomparable (ratio 15031198.1x, likely different directions)",
  "price_trend": "üìà +0.52%",  // Only if comparing same pool
  "preview_rows": [
    {
      "delta_vs_ma": 25.1,       // Realistic percentage
      "delta_vs_prev_row": -0.018  // Small, reasonable change
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

Railway will auto-deploy these fixes within ~3 minutes. The changes are **backwards compatible** - they only add validation, not change data structure.

### Verification Steps
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete
2. Check `/preview` endpoint
3. Verify:
   - `spread_percent` is either reasonable (<50%) or `null` with reason
   - `price_trend` is reasonable (<200%) or missing
   - `delta_vs_ma` values are realistic (<1000%)
   - `delta_vs_prev_row` values are small (<500%)

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Always validate price comparisons** - Don't assume all prices are in the same direction
2. **Calculate first, validate second** - Don't try to pre-validate inputs with complex conditions
3. **Add sanity caps** - Even if logic seems correct, cap extreme values (1000%, 500%, etc.)
4. **Check temporal proximity** - Don't compare values from different time periods
5. **Check entity equality** - Don't compare values from different pools/contracts

## üîÆ Future Improvements

For production-grade arbitrage detection:

1. **Standardize all prices to common base**
   ```python
   def standardize_price(token_in, token_out, price):
       # Always return "USDC per ETH" regardless of swap direction
       if token_in == "WETH" and token_out == "USDC":
           return price  # Already correct
       elif token_in == "USDC" and token_out == "WETH":
           return 1 / price  # Invert
       # ... handle all token pairs
   ```

2. **Use TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)** instead of simple MA

3. **Implement proper arbitrage detection** with gas cost consideration

4. **Add historical spread tracking** to identify persistent opportunities

5. **Support multi-hop arbitrage** (Pool A ‚Üí Pool B ‚Üí Pool C ‚Üí Pool A)

## üéì Self-Reflection

**What I Did Right:**
- ‚úÖ Traced through entire data flow
- ‚úÖ Identified root cause (incompatible price directions)
- ‚úÖ Added defensive sanity checks at multiple layers
- ‚úÖ Fixed ALL related bugs in one commit

**What I Missed Initially:**
- ‚ùå Didn't think about swap direction when first seeing "normalized_price"
- ‚ùå Tried to fix symptoms (caps) before understanding root cause
- ‚ùå Made logic error in first delta_vs_ma fix (checked before calculating)

**Key Insight:**
The core issue wasn't the math logic - it was the **semantic meaning** of the data. `normalized_price` doesn't represent a single thing - it represents different ratios depending on swap direction. This is a data modeling issue, not a calculation bug.
