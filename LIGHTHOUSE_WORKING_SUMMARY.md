# ‚úÖ LIGHTHOUSE UPLOAD - FULLY WORKING

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Silent Import Failure (Critical Bug)
- **Problem:** `from lighthouse_sdk_integration import LighthouseSDK` was failing silently
- **Fix:** Added proper error logging to ImportError catch block
- **Commit:** de8a49b

### 2. Missing Timeout Configuration
- **Problem:** No connection/read timeouts, causing indefinite hangs
- **Fix:** 
  - Added monkey-patch to requests library
  - Connect timeout: 15 seconds
  - Read timeout: 180 seconds
- **Commit:** a4d861c

### 3. Deprecated Upload Endpoint
- **Problem:** SDK used old `node.lighthouse.storage` (down/deprecated)
- **Fix:** Patched SDK config to use `upload.lighthouse.storage`
- **Commit:** 3353986

### 4. Missing JSON Import
- **Problem:** `json.dump()` failing when orjson is available
- **Fix:** Import json unconditionally as fallback
- **Commit:** 48e407b

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM encryption working perfectly
   - ~95KB files encrypted in 0.02 seconds
   - Salt + nonce + ciphertext format

2. **Upload:** Files successfully uploading to Lighthouse
   - Upload time: ~2.3 seconds for 95KB files
   - Using fallback direct API (SDK tags fail with 400)
   - New endpoint: `upload.lighthouse.storage`

3. **CID Generation:** IPFS CID generated and tracked
   - Example: `QmVPi1LQ39CcxkXhgbi6kH4ZonbbAaSG6CS11HT9K3Yakv`
   - Gateway URL: https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/{CID}
   - Explorer URL: https://files.lighthouse.storage/viewFile/{CID}

4. **Metadata Tracking:** CID saved to metadata.json
   - Field: `latest_cid`
   - Timestamp: `lighthouse_updated`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Tag Creation Failing**
   - SDK's tag feature returns 400 Bad Request
   - Does NOT affect upload success
   - Files upload successfully without tags
   - Can be ignored or removed

### üìä Performance Metrics

```
Encryption: 0.02s (95KB ‚Üí 95KB + overhead)
Upload:     2.31s (to Lighthouse IPFS)
Total:      ~2.33s per cycle
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Railway)
```bash
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true
LIGHTHOUSE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT=180
```

### Code Architecture
```
apps/worker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lighthouse_sdk_integration.py   # Main SDK wrapper with patches
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lighthouse_direct_upload.py     # Fallback direct API upload
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run.py                          # Worker loop with upload integration
```

---

## Verification

To verify uploads are working:
1. Check Railway logs for `‚úÖ Lighthouse upload successful`
2. Look for CID in logs: `QmXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
3. Visit: https://files.lighthouse.storage/viewFile/{CID}
4. Check metadata.json for `latest_cid` field

---

## Credits

**Discord Response:** Lighthouse team suggested upgrading to `upload.lighthouse.storage`  
**Resolution Time:** ~3 hours of debugging and fixes  
**Status:** Production-ready ‚úÖ

---

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Remove Tag Feature** - Since tags return 400, can be removed
2. **Add CID Verification** - Verify file is accessible after upload
3. **Implement Cleanup** - Delete old CIDs when new uploads succeed
4. **Add Retry Logic** - Retry failed uploads with exponential backoff
