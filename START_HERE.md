## 🎓 Why Railway (Not Vercel)?

**Your project is a "worker" not a "serverless function":**

- ✅ Runs 24/7 (not per-request)
- ✅ Maintains state between runs
- ✅ Has background threads
- ✅ Writes to disk

**Railway = Perfect fit. Vercel = Wrong tool.**

## 💡 What You'll Learn

By deploying to Railway, you'll understand:
- Traditional vs serverless hosting
- Environment variable management
- Deployment pipelines (GitHub → Railway)
- Monitoring and logging
- Production debugging
- Scaling strategies
