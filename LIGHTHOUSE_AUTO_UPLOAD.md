# Lighthouse Automatic Upload Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Automatic Lighthouse file upload has been integrated into the DEX arbitrage worker pipeline.

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Settings Configuration** (`apps/worker/settings.py`)
Added two new configuration options:
- `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY`: Your Lighthouse Storage API key (from dashboard)
- `LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD`: Toggle to enable/disable automatic upload (default: `True`)

### 2. **Automatic Upload Function** (`apps/worker/run.py`)
Created `upload_to_lighthouse_and_cleanup()` that:
- ✅ Encrypts `dexarb_latest.jsonl` using AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Uploads encrypted file to Lighthouse IPFS
- ✅ Updates `metadata.json` with the new CID
- ✅ Tracks upload timestamp
- ✅ Logs old CID for future cleanup (deletion not yet implemented in SDK)
- ✅ Runs in async executor (non-blocking)

### 3. **Pipeline Integration**
The upload happens **automatically** in the worker cycle:
```
1. Fetch DEX data from Blockscout
2. Transform and enrich swaps
3. Apply rolling window (prune old data)
4. Write dexarb_latest.jsonl
5. Update metadata.json
6. ⚡ UPLOAD TO LIGHTHOUSE (NEW)
7. Update preview.json
8. Sleep, repeat
```

## 📝 Configuration

### Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Lighthouse Storage Integration
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true
```

### Get API Key:
1. Go to https://files.lighthouse.storage/dashboard
2. Click "API Key" in sidebar
3. Create new API key
4. Copy and paste into `.env`

## 🚀 Railway Deployment

### Update Railway Environment Variables:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Navigate to **Variables** tab
3. Add:
   ```
   LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true
   ```
4. Redeploy (Railway auto-deploys on env changes)

## 📊 How It Works

### On Each Worker Cycle:
1. **Check if enabled**: Skip if `LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=false`
2. **Read old CID**: Get previous CID from `metadata.json` for future cleanup
3. **Encrypt file**: Generates unique salt + nonce, encrypts with AES-256-GCM
4. **Upload**: Sends encrypted file to Lighthouse IPFS
5. **Update metadata**: Writes new CID to `metadata.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "latest_cid": "QmXxxx...",
     "lighthouse_updated": "2024-01-15T12:34:56Z"
   }
   ```
6. **Log cleanup**: Notes old CID for manual deletion (auto-delete coming soon)

### File Naming:
Uploaded files are tagged with:
- Tag: `dexarb_{network_name}` (e.g., `dexarb_Ethereum Mainnet`)
- Original name preserved in metadata

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ **Encrypted at rest**: All uploads use AES-256-GCM encryption
- ✅ **Unique salt/nonce**: Each encryption uses fresh cryptographic material
- ✅ **Password-protected**: Can add custom password (currently uses API key derivation)
- ✅ **No plaintext exposure**: Original file never leaves your server unencrypted

## 📍 Viewing Files

### Dashboard:
https://files.lighthouse.storage/dashboard

### Direct CID Access:
```
https://files.lighthouse.storage/viewFile/{CID}
```

### Gateway (if decrypted):
```
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/{CID}
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check logs for upload status:
```bash
railway logs
```

Look for:
```
📤 Uploading dexarb_latest.jsonl to Lighthouse...
✅ Lighthouse upload successful in 2.45s
   CID: QmXxxx...
   View: https://files.lighthouse.storage/viewFile/QmXxxx...
✓ Lighthouse CID: QmXxxx...
```

### Check metadata.json:
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/metadata | jq '.latest_cid'
```

## 🧹 File Rotation (Manual for Now)

The system tracks old CIDs but **does not automatically delete** them yet because:
- Lighthouse Python SDK doesn't expose delete API
- Requires direct REST API call with authentication

### Manual cleanup:
1. Go to https://files.lighthouse.storage/dashboard
2. View file list
3. Delete old versions manually

### Coming Soon:
- Automatic deletion of old CID when new file uploaded
- Configurable retention (keep last N uploads)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Upload disabled message:
```
Lighthouse upload disabled (LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=False)
```
**Fix**: Set `LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true` in `.env`

### API key not set:
```
Lighthouse upload enabled but LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY not set
```
**Fix**: Add `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=xxx` to `.env`

### SDK not available:
```
Lighthouse SDK not available - file upload disabled
```
**Fix**: Install SDK:
```bash
pip install lighthouseweb3>=0.1.5
```

### Upload failed:
```
Lighthouse upload error: [error details]
```
**Fix**: Check Railway logs for detailed error, verify API key is correct

## 📦 Files Modified

1. `apps/worker/settings.py` - Added `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` and `LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD`
2. `apps/worker/run.py` - Added upload function and pipeline integration

## ✅ Testing

### Local Test (will fail on network but verifies logic):
```bash
cd /Users/shreyas/Desktop/af_hosted
source .venv/bin/activate
python apps/worker/run.py
```

### Railway Test (should work):
1. Push changes: `git push railway main`
2. Wait for deployment
3. Check logs: `railway logs`
4. Verify dashboard: https://files.lighthouse.storage/dashboard

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Worker starts without errors  
✅ Each cycle logs "📤 Uploading dexarb_latest.jsonl..."  
✅ Upload completes with "✅ Lighthouse upload successful"  
✅ CID appears in `metadata.json`  
✅ File visible in Lighthouse dashboard  
✅ Old CID logged for future cleanup  

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test on Railway**: Push changes and verify upload works
2. **Implement Auto-Delete**: Add REST API call to delete old CIDs
3. **Add Retention Policy**: Keep last N uploads, delete older
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Add CID link to preview.json
5. **Prize Submission**: Submit to ETHOnline Lighthouse challenge! 🏆
