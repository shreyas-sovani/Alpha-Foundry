## 5. Test Lighthouse Upload (Optional)

```bash
railway link  # Link to your project
railway run bash  # SSH into container

# Inside container:
python -c "
from apps.worker.lighthouse_sdk_integration import LighthouseSDK
import os
lh = LighthouseSDK(api_key=os.getenv('LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY'))
print('‚úì Lighthouse SDK ready')
"
```

## Done! üéâ

Your Lighthouse integration is live. Upload will work from Railway's servers.
