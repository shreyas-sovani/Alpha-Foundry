## 🎉 What Happens After Deployment

Once deployed, your worker will:
1. ✅ Start polling Uniswap V3 pools every 15 seconds
2. ✅ Fetch and process swap events
3. ✅ Serve 3 public endpoints globally
4. ✅ Auto-recover from errors
5. ✅ Persist state between restarts

**Your endpoints will be:**
- `https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/health`
- `https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/preview`
- `https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/metadata`

**Use these in:**
- Your Hosted Agent
- dApp UI
- Hackathon demos
- Future DataCoin integration

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor logs** during first deployment
2. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for first data to appear
3. **Upgrade to Starter plan** ($5/mo) for hackathon reliability
4. **Set up alerts** in Railway for crashes
5. **Test all endpoints** before sharing with judges
