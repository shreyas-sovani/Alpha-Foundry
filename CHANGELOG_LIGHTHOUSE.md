# üéØ What Changed - Lighthouse Auto Upload

## Summary
Integrated automatic encrypted file upload to Lighthouse IPFS into the DEX arbitrage worker pipeline. Now every time the worker updates `dexarb_latest.jsonl`, it automatically encrypts and uploads the file to Lighthouse.

## Files Modified

### 1. `apps/worker/settings.py`
**Lines Added: 88-90**
```python
# Lighthouse Integration - NEW
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY: Optional[str] = ""  # API key for Lighthouse Storage
LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD: bool = True  # Enable automatic upload to Lighthouse
```

**Lines Added: 148-150** (in print_redacted method)
```python
print(f"\n  üîê LIGHTHOUSE STORAGE:")
print(f"    - Upload enabled: {'‚úÖ' if self.LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD else '‚ùå'}")
print(f"    - API key: {'‚úÖ SET' if self.LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY else '‚ùå NOT SET'}")
```

### 2. `apps/worker/run.py`
**Lines Added: 27-36** (after imports)
```python
# Lighthouse Storage integration
try:
    from lighthouse_sdk_integration import LighthouseSDK
    LIGHTHOUSE_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    LIGHTHOUSE_AVAILABLE = False
    logger.warning("Lighthouse SDK not available - file upload disabled")
```

**Lines Added: ~680-777** (new async function)
```python
async def upload_to_lighthouse_and_cleanup(
    jsonl_path: Path,
    metadata_path: Path,
    settings: Settings
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Upload the latest JSONL file to Lighthouse and delete old uploads.
    
    Returns the new CID if successful, None if upload disabled or failed.
    """
    # [Full implementation with encryption, upload, metadata update]
```

**Lines Added: ~1237-1244** (integration into run_cycle)
```python
# Upload to Lighthouse (if enabled)
lighthouse_cid = await upload_to_lighthouse_and_cleanup(
    jsonl_path=jsonl_path,
    metadata_path=metadata_path,
    settings=settings
)
if lighthouse_cid:
    logger.info(f"‚úì Lighthouse CID: {lighthouse_cid}")
```

### 3. `LIGHTHOUSE_AUTO_UPLOAD.md` (NEW)
Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- What was implemented
- Configuration steps
- Railway deployment
- How it works
- Security features
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting

### 4. `RAILWAY_LIGHTHOUSE_SETUP.md` (NEW)
Quick setup guide for Railway deployment:
- Step-by-step API key setup
- Verification steps
- Success indicators
- Troubleshooting

## How It Works

### Before (Manual):
```
Worker Cycle:
1. Fetch data
2. Transform data
3. Write dexarb_latest.jsonl
4. Update metadata.json
5. Update preview.json
[No upload - manual testing only]
```

### After (Automatic):
```
Worker Cycle:
1. Fetch data
2. Transform data
3. Write dexarb_latest.jsonl
4. Update metadata.json
5. üÜï ENCRYPT & UPLOAD TO LIGHTHOUSE
   - Read old CID from metadata
   - Encrypt file with AES-256-GCM
   - Upload to Lighthouse IPFS
   - Get new CID
   - Update metadata.json with CID
   - Log old CID for cleanup
6. Update preview.json
```

## Configuration Required

Add to `.env` (local) or Railway Variables (production):
```bash
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LIGHTHOUSE_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true
```

## Expected Behavior

### Every 15 seconds (one worker cycle):
1. **Logs show**:
   ```
   üì§ Uploading dexarb_latest.jsonl to Lighthouse...
   ‚úÖ Lighthouse upload successful in 2.45s
      CID: QmXxxx...
      View: https://files.lighthouse.storage/viewFile/QmXxxx...
   ‚úì Lighthouse CID: QmXxxx...
   ```

2. **metadata.json updated**:
   ```json
   {
     "latest_cid": "QmXxxx...",
     "lighthouse_updated": "2024-01-15T12:34:56Z"
   }
   ```

3. **Lighthouse dashboard shows**:
   - New encrypted file
   - Tagged with network name
   - Accessible via CID

## Security

- ‚úÖ Files encrypted with AES-256-GCM before upload
- ‚úÖ Unique salt + nonce per encryption
- ‚úÖ API key stored in environment variables (not committed)
- ‚úÖ No plaintext data exposed

## Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Code syntax verified
- ‚úÖ Import paths correct
- ‚úÖ Async/await handling proper
- ‚è≥ Production test pending (need to add API key to Railway)

## Next Steps

1. **Add LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY to Railway** ‚Üí Automatic redeploy
2. **Monitor logs** ‚Üí Verify upload messages appear
3. **Check Lighthouse dashboard** ‚Üí See encrypted files
4. **Verify metadata endpoint** ‚Üí CID appears in JSON
5. **Submit to ETHOnline challenge** üèÜ
